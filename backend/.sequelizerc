// .sequelizerc is a special configuration file. It lets you specify the following options that you would usually pass as arguments to CLI:

// env:               The environment to run the command in
// config:            The path to the config file
// options-path:      The path to a JSON file with additional options
// migrations-path:   The path to the migrations folder
// seeders-path:      The path to the seeders folder
// models-path:       The path to the models folder
// url:               The database connection string to use. Alternative to using --config files
// debug:             When available show various debug information



const path = require('path'); // importing the path object from node

console.log("Current directory:", __dirname); // prints the current directory

module.exports = {
  config: path.resolve('config', 'database.js'),        // tells CLI to use this file for config settings by calling resolve method of path
  'models-path': path.resolve('db', 'models'),          // tells CLI to use the db/models folder by calling resolve method of path
  'seeders-path': path.resolve('db', 'seeders'),        // tells CLI to use the db/seeders folder by calling resolve method of path
  'migrations-path': path.resolve('db', 'migrations'),  // tells CLI to use the db/migrations folder by calling resolve method of path
};

// the resolve method helps for constructing absolute paths from relative path segments
